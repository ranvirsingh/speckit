# [TITLE]

**Type**: Feature
**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  Fill out with concrete edge cases relevant to the feature.
  If no edge cases apply, replace this section with:
  [NOT APPLICABLE] — {reason why no edge cases exist}
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Fill out with concrete functional requirements.
  If this is a Bug or Chore, replace this section with:
  [NOT APPLICABLE] — {reason, e.g., "This is a chore; scope and acceptance criteria above fully describe the work."}
  
  NEVER leave placeholder text like "System MUST [specific capability]" in the final issue body.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

<!--
  If no data model changes are needed, replace with:
  [NOT APPLICABLE] — No data model changes in this feature.
-->

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
  NEVER leave placeholder examples in the final issue body.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Concrete measurable metric for this specific feature]
- **SC-002**: [Concrete measurable metric for this specific feature]
- **SC-003**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
